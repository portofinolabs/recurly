Thanks for helping us build Recurly's Go library! This page contains requirements and guidelines for contributions.

#### Requirements
* New objects must include type assertions in the service and mock. 
* New services need to be added to `services.go` and in the `mock` package. 
* This package uses `cmp` instead of `reflect` for tests. All submissions must include tests. 
* Please follow the Go Standard Library style (for example, line comments should end with a period but inline comments should not).  

#### Problems or questions?
The best place to ask dev related questions is in `Issues` for this repo.
